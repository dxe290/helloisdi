## FINAL PROJECT

**Cuban Documentary Filmmaking Database**

*WORK IN PROGRESS*


## Corpus of the Proposal:

*Introduction*

The following critical introduction is a document related to the main ideas, goals, principles of inclusion, significance, goals, challenges, and constraints associated with my proposal “Cuban Documentary Filmmaking Dataset”. This “work in progress” dataset is presented for the DH Notebook and class, but the project has passioned me, and I hope to continue working on it. Therefore, I want to provide a descriptive overview of the dataset and the metadata included. Later, I incorporate the context of the data and the data collection process alongside some of its features and limitations. Finally, I analyze some of the main issues creating this dataset and how this process of collecting considered academic and critical readings related to the Digital Humanities field. 

*Section 1*

As a result of the need to submit a final project for the class “Topics in DH: Humanities Data class”, I began to think about possible proposals to create an introduction to a dataset. The project in the first instance and as the main requirement had to be original. Hence, as a student interested in the field of Digital Humanities, but also in film studies, I wanted to make a proposal that involved the seventh art. My research interests consider the area of Latin America, especially Cuba. For this reason, the spectrum of analysis was reduced to this geography, and very particularly to the documentary genre.

The idea of this initiative started with my B.A dissertation about Cuban documentary filmmaking. I could notice how difficult it is for the Cuban documentaries, most of them out of the mainstream, to get visibility and an audience. Much of the time, the films even in Cuba, follow a circuit of production, festivals, awards, and finally, if they have the chance, the exhibition. This process occurs regularly with fiction movies because documentaries do not always have the same opportunities. Also, the film critic pays attention to the fiction, and the nonfiction becomes less important. Therefore, I was fascinated for offering a project that considers the documentary film production which is why I created the “Cuban Documentary Filmmaking Dataset”. 

*Context before the 90s*

This proposal is about the Cuban documentary from the ’90s until 2020. The dataset collects this information and includes films made by different production companies on the island, but also independent movies and others produced in the diaspora. The latter is a unique feature in this dataset compared with other sources which can contain similar information. Consequently, and for the purpose of this proposal, I decided to opt for films released in the last three decades because before 1990 most of the production made in Cuba was produced by the Cuban Institute of Art and Cinematographic Industry (ICAIC). This official institution was the one that started to record the splendid first years of the Cuban Revolution. The ICAIC allocated resources to a production less expensive than the fiction. Also, as an official interest this production was the one that could mirror or reflect the social and political events of the Revolution. For these reasons the first documentaries and documentarianswere born with the effort of funding and organizing an industry, able to keep cinematic images the history. 

Hence, we subsequently find much greater accessibility and information collected about the documentary films made in the first three decades after the revolution. There are some sources and books that are not exclusive to this period but compile much of their content in this material. For example, the official website [cubacine.cu](http://www.cubacine.cult.cu/es/filmes) and [cinematecadecuba.cult.cu](cinematecadecuba.cult.cu), both by the ICAIC. Also, some bibliography like Coordenadas del cine cubano; Los Cien Caminos del Cine Cubano; El Cine Cubano a Contraluz; Cine Cubano: la Pupila Insomne and Romper la tensión del Arco, among others. Most of them were published by the ICAIC as anthologies, chronologies, or groups of critical essays.    

However, with the foundation of the Ministry of Culture (MINCULT) in 1976, the ICAIC starts gradually to lose the autonomy of the film production. A period of institutionalization started, and this brought the appearance of different producer houses and then, the diversification of the nature of documentary production. For example, the film section of the Cuban army (FAR) emerged, alongside with Department of Educative Cinematography of the Ministry of Education (CINED), the Cinematographic Studios of the Cuban Institute of Radio and Television (EC-ICRT), the National Federation of Cinema Clubs and some workshops like the one of Cinema and Video of the Brothers Saíz Association (AHS). Years later, the International School of Cinema and Television of San Antonio de Los Baños (1986) starts as a romantic project guided by the Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez and the Argentine director Fernando Birri. Many productions in all the cinematic genres emerged as a result of academic projects. Finally, within the Special Period in the ’90s, also begins a community-based television and video collective called Television Serrana (1993) and located in the mountain range Sierra Maestra.  

Thus, this is briefly the context of the cinematography industry in Cuba; what we have by the end of the 80s and the early beginning of the 90s is a diverse scenario with opportunities for the development of documentary filmmaking. But the promising situation for the genre and its directors is affected by the collapse of the Socialist camp and the entry into Cuba in 1990 of the greatest economic crisis in the country's history. All this translates into many production companies that closed or merged with others, like the closure of the film section of the Cuban army or the Department of Educative Cinematography of the Ministry of Education, for example. Then, co-productions begin as an exit to finance national cinema and more attention is paid to fiction because it is more commercial. Lastly, with the new decade commences the introduction of digital technology, and the recording is more accessible. As a consequence, many directors emigrated, and others became independent and filmed outside of the official main circuit and made their own productions. For these reasons, after this maelstrom in the cultural field, we find the collection of footage and films disperse, attached to many transformations, and inaccurate in terms of its archive and datasheet. 

To highlight the role of this kind of film and the critical thinking after the period, I defined the Cuban documentary as all the documentaries produced in Cuba, but also all the documentaries produced by a Cuban. Therefore, I included films produced from the diaspora by Cubans for considering that group of directors that emigrated. I got involved in finding as many sources as possible to create this proposal and present a compiled bibliography of the Cuban Documentary from 1990 until 2020.

*The Collection*

Nowadays, most of the producer companies from the beginning of the 90s do not have a branch, either a cinematheque or a website for consulting information. The majority of the sources are books and websites by the ICAIC about official films. There are only some websites or archives which contain information related to this topic. However, none of them has focused specifically on compelling and giving importance to the Cuban documentary films including the one from the diaspora. There is not either an established or robust collection of materials around this precise theme. 

If we want to find the “other” outsider production, it is necessary to consult alternative sources where Cuban movies can be found like Vimeo, YouTube, and IMDB. Likewise, it is possible to find information in the new work in progress project “Enciclopedia Digital del Audiovisual Cubano” (endac.org), that were born in 2021 but lacks yet for including films from the diaspora. For that reason, I started the selection process by searching first the official websites, then looking up the alternative sources. This context made more significant the necessity for creating this dataset, but also means for the purpose of this dataset a work of scaffolding, cleaning, and filtering data according to the principles of inclusion related to the period and the definition of Cuban film relevant to the proposal.

Thus, I provide a broad overview of the dataset and its different metadata fields. Each metadata corresponds to a documentary released between 1990 and 2020 in Cuba and/or by a Cuban. During the process of collecting information, I realized that some of my metadata fields in some films are empty because nowadays there is no record of this information in the sources that I was able to consult. The latter means for the research purposes the necessity to continue working in further time to find more data. 

Until the moment of presenting this Critical Introduction, the dataset is a collection of around a hundred documentary films that I, as a researcher, have cleaned through the process of filtering and collecting the info. For the dataset, I needed to include a metadata field about “Notes” because of the nature of the film and the actual condition of its archival information, source, or production company. 

*Metadata*

Title: This field contains the title of the film as this one was released. 

Production Date: It indicates the date the film was produced; dates only include the year of production, which is defaulted as January 1st. 

Director(s): This field shows the full names of the director or directors associated with the film. 

Producer Company: Production company indicates the company the film is associated with at the moment of release

*Boundaries and scope*

In developing the “Cuban Documentary Filmmaking Dataset” there were some boundaries. The scholar’s dilemma about structure and conceptualization was working with several information sources that exist on the web dispersed and/ or mixed with other issues, genres, geographies, periods of analysis, or even incomplete. The nature of materials is diverse, and this represents a different kind of metadata. This can produce some limits and it occurs because these kinds of films do not have open or free access, they may not exist archived in their original production company, or even they may have been censured or produced very outsider to the official Cuban mainstream.  

The scope of this proposal underlines how these productions have also contributed Cuban cinematography industry on and outside the island. The dataset is unique and significant because could facilitate the clarification of many research questions like Which has been Cuban documentarians in the last three decades? Where did the biggest documentary film production come from? What happened with some of the producer companies, or which are the ones that do not exist anymore? Which are the sources where to find these films? 

On one hand, I consider the dataset unique because its research approach facilitates the consultation of a specific audience interested in this cinematic field. However, the simplicity of the design conception also makes it possible to get the interest of public fans of the seventh art, particularly in Cuban cinema. On the other hand, making visible and researchable in one place the Cuban documentary filmmaking production. Likewise, it provides a directory in chronological order of titles, films, and producers. Lastly, it gives specific information about each film, like a datasheet.

*Reflection* 
I obviously dealt with many limitations making the collection for this dataset, and I think the curatorial and cleaning part were the struggling ones. Then, my proposal involved the necessity of making emphasis in the Cuban documentary genre following the principles of inclusion described above. Hence, as part of the research process the input was very variable, disperse and disorganized. Capturing the data not using an algorithmic method was a laborious work. I did not use any software or tool to get my data. Subsequently, I had to make my interpretation of the data and enter it manually to the dataset. 

According to Julia Flanders and Trevor Muñoz, in the humanities field is relevant to ensure that the representations of the objects of study functions effectively as data. Therefore, I had to select and translate the data into one with high-functional form. The “Cuban Documentary Filmmaking Dataset” demanded interpretive layering; the field about “Notes” was extremely important in some cases because it allows me to explain, emend or comment the metadata which conceded a remarkable value to the edition. The latter reinforces what Flanders and Munoz contends about the research decisions: “the choice of source (the edition or in some cases the specific copy that serves as the basis for the digital object), the calibration of instrumentation (including color balancing, lighting, camera settings, sampling rates), the method of data capture (such as OCR, double-keying, etc.), the details of transcription (including regularization, handling of illegibility and uncertainty, handling of specialcharacters), the details of the encoding scheme used (including whatever extensions or customizations have been made to it), the level and type of quality assurance testing and error correction, the kinds of editorial oversight that have been exercised, and the details of any subsequent curatorial activity.” This step gave to the curator, me as researcher, the responsibility, and the editorial voice. It provided not only significance and a distinctive sense to the corpus compared with other existing sources, but also an alternative view of the data. 

In the same way, data cleaning was relevant in the initial phase of data-intensive research. The idea of cleaning involved the idea of messy in this proposal because data was not present in just one place or source, either a place addressed to this kind of information. The formation of this dataset was an exercise of organizing data, which demonstrates (as we practiced in Lab 3) how the researchers follow strategics and rationalities for the structuration of the info that emphasize the possibility of practicing power. Data cleaning is the implementation of technical solutions to a particular -imagined- technical problem, like, in my case, the dispersion and unavailability of some data, ending in some empty rows or fields. However, as a quantitative and qualitative exercise, visualization of data is mediated by some patterns. We as scholars and researchers need to be clear about the main goal in the research to avoid some “problem” or “occlusion” that can obscure important features or info, in general. It remarks what Katie Rawson and Trevor Muñoz refer when they say that “the structure and content of a specific archive or collection represent and even re-create certain cultural logics”. Certainly, the process of curation and cleaning in this dataset allow me to think in the importance of inclusion. For example, how important is it to include some relevant voices as documentarians in Cuba who most of the time are not part of the Cuban documentary filmmaking history, not only because of some cultural logics of the archivist or compilers, but also because of some power exercise that reproduce official practices and/or do not question the status quo and establishment within this cultural field. Then, this is translated into some films that “do not count”. The latter, finally, remind me the reading “What gets Counted Counts” by Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein whose insist in the necessity of avoiding assumptions and beliefs behind classification “as well as consistently probe who is doing the counting and whose interests are served.” Counting become a tool for removing some oppressions or silences within a collectivity or community. Despite the issues and limitations presented, and far from exhibiting a finished dataset,  I am sure that this “work in progress”  could be an opportunity for the documentary genre in the Island and outside its geographic frontiers to considering and rebalance unequal distributions of power and visibility.
