Analysing the Race Film Database

The Race Film Database is an initiative that was born on the campus of the University of California in 2016. Specifically undergraduate and graduate students from the Digital Humanities program showed their interest in intervening in favor of the debate about people of color in the American film industry. The project seeks to propose a database on early African American silent race films created before 1930 for African-American audiences. 

Miriam Posner and Mariam Cifor contend that the main goal was to create a database with information from a wide range of primary and secondary sources. The central principle determining which data include or not was strictly following the time frame and audience described above. 

I consider that one of the most important values and strengths of this database is the preoccupation with the topic of racism within the film industry and the aim to publish a long history of black filmmakers over fifty years in the United States. The latter reminds me of the reading “What Gets Counted Counts” by Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein when they affirm that there is a rhetoric behind data analysis, a rhetoric of inclusion, exclusion, and a way to reading data. It is phenomenal to publish this kind of database because reminds us as scholars, but also people involved in the cinema industry and spectators in general that data counts not only quantitative speaking but also qualitative. As D’Ignazio and Kelin argue “this includes visualizations that do not deliberately intend to persuade people of a certain message. It especially and definitively includes those so-called neutral visualizations that do not appear to have an editorial hand. In fact, those might even be the most perniciously persuasive visualizations of all!” (2020). 

Even when this kind of topic is not completed new for a database, this one contains important documents from African American newspapers, scholarly books, articles in film studies, filmography, and, extraordinary valuable documents extracted from the Library Special Collections, specifically a set of documents called the George P. Johnson Negro Film Collection. Consequently, this database provides and demonstrates with numbers the presence of African American Black filmmakers in the industry. 

The team decided to present a collection with a relational database which allows them to present multiple data and linked tables. Indeed, they proposed very well-organized datasets for people, companies, films, and sources. According to Posner and Cifor, this makes possible “the ability to separate data into discrete tables and for users to make complex queries without a great deal of technical knowledge. A user can manage and query at a fairly specific level, for example, searching for “all films produced by companies based in Missouri before 1920” (711). I consider that one significant aspect for scholars, researchers, and professors in the process of building this database was determining which data would be part of the corpus. 

If we analyze deeply this database, we can notice that there is a huge amount of data which were cleaned. The process of cleaning the data started from the point of deciding which people and films include in the Race Film Database, considering and conceptualizing at some point what the developers understand for “race films”, “black people” or even “black audience”. Thus, I bring back Katie Rawson and Trevor Muñoz (2019) when contending that data cleaning is an important part of collecting information because as these researchers from theUniversity of California did, scholars have to think about their standpoint, horizon, and perspective. In this proposal, I contemplate that was relevant to the finality and goals of the database because the scholars had to discuss and decided those films that were discussed as race films at the time. Posner and Cifor argue that they “then winnowed the list down and preserved the “discarded data” as part of the race film data set so that interested researchers can investigate our decisions for themselves” (712). Therefore, there was a process that avoid simplification and assumptions from other fields or standardization. They based the database on their experience, context and included “that” data that could be marginalized in any other similar film or cinema industry database. I am referring to that data embedded or reduced to a category that even does not pay attention to diversity. As developers conclude “The database, then, is an example of theory-engaged practice: to build the database with integrity and accuracy, all project participants needed to have a shared understanding of how race works: not only the way it structures lives and livelihoods, but also the way it fails to fully describe the entirety of any individual’s lived experience” (713).

Finally, this process of scrutiny involved three different datasets that I believe maybe they should not be ending sources, instead of being expanded for future avenues and data collection and then visualization. On the other hand, another beneficial feature of the Race Film Database is the open-source conception of the data. Developers provided a project publicly available on Github, downloadable as CVS files, or on Airtable. The latter proposes an approach to the data not as information that requires the permission of “owners” or empowered people to access it. Instead, the very valuable extra point in this project is the assumption from the beginning by its researchers to provide an engaging database whose information can be reused or even corrected on Github. This put the power and control of the data in an evolving perspective for the scholarly field and knowledge.
