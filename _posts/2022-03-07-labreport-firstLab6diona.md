Analysing the Race Film Database

Introduction

The Race Film Database is an initiative that was born in the campus of the University of California in 2016. Specifically undergraduate and graduate students from the Digital Humanities program showed their interested in making an intervention in favor of the debate about people of color in the American film industry. The project seeks to propose a database on early African-American silent race films created before 1930 for African-American audiences. 

Miriam Posner and Mariam Cifor contend that the main goal was create a database with information in a wide range of primary and secondary sources. The main principle determining which data include or not, was strictly following the time frame and audience described above. 

I consider that one of the most important value and strengths of this database is the preoccupation for the topic about racism within the film industry and the aim to publish a long history of black filmmakers over fifty years in united States. The latter remind me the reading “What Gets Counts” by by Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein. Even when this kind of topic is not completed new for a database, this one contains important documents from African American newspapers, scholarly books, articles in film studies, filmography and, extraordinary valuable documents extracted from the Library Special Collections, specifically a set of documents called the George P. Johnson Negro Film Collection. 

Therefore, the team decided to present a collection with a relational database which allows them presents multiple data and linked tables. Indeed, they proposed datasets for people, companies, films and sources. According to Posner and Cifor, this makes possible “the ability to separate data into discrete tables and for users to make complex queries without a great deal of technical knowledge. A user is able to manage and query at a fairly specific level, for example, searching for “all films produced by companies based in Missouri before 1920” (711).
