Analysing the Race Film Database

Introduction

The Race Film Database is an initiative that was born in the campus of the University of California in 2016. Specifically undergraduate and graduate students from the Digital Humanities program showed their interested in making an intervention in favor of the debate about people of color in the American film industry. The project seeks to propose a database on early African-American silent race films created before 1930 for African-American audiences.
