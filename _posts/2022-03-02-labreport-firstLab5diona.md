## Python and the questions

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

1. What do you notice about how this function has split the string “Okay, okay, ladies, now let’s get in formation, cause I slay”? What has it done that isn’t quite right, and why has it done this? Write down your response in your notes document.

2. What happened? Did it work as you expected? If not, what happened that you didn’t expect? Write down your response in your notes document.

3. Describe the output of this script (the dataframe that displays after the above cell finishes running). Remember that this is the same output as the “vir-ver-counts-specific” spreadsheet in our Lab5 Google drive folder, only for just 10 texts. What is this dataframe showing us? Write down your response in your notes document.

4. Look at the below lines from the compare_counts_specific function above. These lines use regular expressions to do something to the value of the <date> field in an xml file (if the contents of the <date> field meet certain conditions, that is). What are these lines doing?
