## Spreedsheets

**1. Exploring the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Dataset: [Diona trans-atlantic-slave-trade](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12VYMBF51FRHnUrtBAEDrJJsCkORSHIH-1q4r6XCoKGU/edit?usp=sharing)**

## Notebook Entry 2

We learned in class how to create a pivot table from the “Trans-Atlantic-Slave-trade dataset” and its spreadsheet. We practiced creating one pivot table for “Year of arrival at port of disembarkation”. We played with Rows and Values to notice how we can “read” the data and its signification. 

In addition, this Lab2 required to create three more pivot tables: “Particular outcome of voyages”, “Outcome of voyages for slaves” and “African Resistance”. Then, I decided to create two more pivot tables: “Total embarked” and “Year constructed”. 

After these first attends creating pivot tables, I explored the Post45 HathiTrust data focusing on the metadata and their description. I created two pivot tables with this data, one with “genres” and the other one with “geographics”. The pivot table “genres” displays the different types of genres collected for this dataset, and how frequent in terms of quantity, how many occurrences were found between 1945-2000. The table (and the chart) showed explicitly which genres were more founded. 

On the other hand, the Pivot Table “geographics” my main concern was to know what the countries or territories with the biggest quantity of tittles were. I organized the rows descending and then I explored how to introduce a chart. This last step helped me a lot to visualized better the data. I realized that the main area were England and United States, and specifically New York. I decided to use the pie form because it displays better this data. 

In general, the Post45 HathiTrust was little hard to work with, because I consider it has too many metadata included. The latter does not mean that this data is not necessary or not well presented, on the contrary, this dataset shows a very careful work behind collecting the information. However, in several columns, such as the “genres” one, it can be seen (even more visible in the pivot tables) how the same genre has various subdivisions and denominations. For example, the category “Christian fiction” has ten ways to be counted. The latter makes me think about what criteria the creators of this dataset followed to make these subdivisions and what parameters were followed to perform the "data cleaning". I believe that with this dataset, a researcher is certainly faced with a large amount of data that must be reconsidered in a certain way. On the other hand, it can also help where the data was originally obtained and what were the research questions that they wanted to answer or the data that they wanted to expose. In a general sense, I think there should be greater coherence. This dataset is an example of how the creation of subcategories or the exposition of huge amount of information, or the lack of uniformity, can make the investigation a little more awkward or complex, a result that is surprisingly contrary to what is expected. 

Finally, the Transatlantic dataset give us sensitive information that could help to understand a huge part of the phenomenon of the slavery. However, at the same time, as Catherine de Ignazio and Lauren Klein argue in Chapter 3, there is a rhetoric behind the data analysis that as researchers we need to consider, but also as observers of the data. 
The data counts, but all so counts what we interpretate from this one. It is not only a quantitative approach, but also essentially qualitative. The authors contend that “the question of rhetoric matters because “a rhetorical dimension is present in every design,” says visualization researcher Jessica Hullman. Undefined This includes visualizations that do not deliberately intend to persuade people of a certain message. It especially and definitively includes those so-called neutral visualizations that do not appear to have an editorial hand. In fact, those might even be the most perniciously persuasive visualizations of all!” 
This database provides and demonstrates with numbers the brutality and the excessive violence of the slavery, showing data related to sickness, murders, infections and on. The archival documentation does not count the consequences and the horrific scene of any crime in the slavery times.
