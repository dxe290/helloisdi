## Abstract

**Young Latin American Documentary Filmmaking Archive and Database

*WORK IN PROGRESS 

Abstract 

As interested student in the Digital Humanities field, but also in the Cinema Studies I am fascinated for offering a project that considers the production of Latin American filmmakers, especially their intervention with the documentary genre within the film and audiovisual industry of the region. The idea of this initiative started with my B.A dissertation about Cuban documentary filmmaking. I could notice how difficult it is for the Latin American films, out of the mainstream, get visibility and audience. Most of the time, the films follow a circuit of production, festivals, awards and finally, if they have the chance, the exhibition. This process occurs regularly with fictions movies because the documentaries do not always have the same opportunities.  The film critic pays attention to the fiction, and the nonfiction can become less important. To highlight the role of this kind of films and the critical thinking, I get involved in finding as many sources as possible for create this proposal. 

I am aware that this “film industry” is not the most commercial one or known by the public. It is difficult to find a completed register, archive, or documented site where this cinematographic genre produced -specifically in Latin American- is record. For those reasons, I propose a database about documentaries of the last three decades and this time frame is the main principle to call the proposal Young Latin American Documentary Filmmaking Archive and Database.  Thus, the innovation in this project is not only the possibility to offer a collection of data related to the productions in this genre, but also their director, companies, or producers. I include documentary filmmaking from 1990 to nowadays. 

There are many useful platforms, cinematheques or websites with similar topics. However, none of them has focused specifically on the importance of the most recent documentary films in the Latin American area, their contributions, and the film critics around these. There is not either an established or robust collection of Latin American materials around this precise topic. The scholar’s dilemma about structure and conceptualization is work with an amount of information sources that exist on the web dispersed and/ or mixed with other issues, genres, geographies, or periods of analysis. The initiative integrates an archive of essays or publications related, because I realized that there are many journals, paper conferences and discussions that most of the time do not go through more spaces of discussions. Also, they remain in the academic circuit without any compilation with papers discussing around same topics or films.  

Then, the archive is presented as a project website with a database on GitHub. Young Latin American Documentary Filmmaking Archive and Database highlights the work of many Latin American directors, but also the relevance of their films within the Latin American cinematography. The research underlines how these productions have also contributed to the debate on film studies. Likewise, it has promoted the critical thinking around some narratives, topics, and the practice of the film reviews.

The database could facilitate the clarification of many research questions like: Which are the youngest filmmakers in Latin American? Where the biggest documentary films production come from? Which are the films more provocative and why? What are the main topics or concerns within these narratives? 

The digital corpus enables and increases the accessibility and analysis of technical datasheets and other data that are in many cases difficult to get accurate. This occurs because this kind of films does not have an open or free access, either impact in the audience or for promoting academic analysis. For that reason, this is an ambitious project and I recognize that the nature of materials is diverse, and this represents different kind of metadata. It should be cleaned and presented in a well-organized, that could also be updated regularly.  

The latter could add to the project a constant work in progress concept if developers decided continuing increasing the corpus. Nonetheless, the project has the feature of present an open-source conception of the data. This means, that the information collected is publicly available in GitHub and downloadable as CVS files. 

Finally, the approach to the data is in an engaging way. The initiative has the goal to become a Digital Humanities project with information that can be reused, corrected, or updated in other research. The increasing interest on Film Studies field within academia it is an opportunity to propose a project useful for researchers, professors, students of undergraduate and graduate levels, or even cinephiles. All the material included in the database will help to the analysis not only from the film studies theory, but also from cultural studies standpoint, transnational themes, ideological or political topics among many others.
