title: Welcome
subtitle: I am an ABD PhD student in Cultural Studies and Literature from the Michelle Bowman Underwood Department of Modern Languages and Literatures at the University of Miami. I graduated in Journalism from the School of Communications at the University of Havana, Cuba, and then I obtained a postgraduate certificate from Alberto Hurtado University, Chile. I have participated as a speaker in several conferences and talks like the Latin American Studies Association Conference (2016), the Graduate Student Cuban Studies Symposium at Harvard University, and the Middle Atlantic Council of Latin American Studies (MACLAS, 2019) among other symposia and academic events. My book "La zozobra en el ojo del huracán”, won in 2016 the Cuban National Award “Sed de Belleza”, and it was published at the Havana International Book Fair the same year. My dissertation topic explores the works of different playwrights from Cuba, Puerto Rico, and their diasporas in the United States. It focuses on plays that follow contemporary documentary theater models in two countries with commonalities in their history, identity, and nation-building experiences. Both dramatic traditions combine realism with formal and aesthetic experimentation, including the inclusion of new media and technology in their theatrical proposals. My theoretical framework thrives at the intersections of Media and Theater/Performance Studies and through an interdisciplinary approach, I analyze the plays Antigonón, un contingente épico (2012) by Rogelio Orizondo and El gran disparo del arte (2020) by Agnieska Hernández (both from Cuba), and La nostalgia del quinqué…una huida (1999) and Composiciones escénicas del yo (2006) by Teresa Hernández (both from Puerto Rico) to explores what kind of documents are used in this documentary theater.  The research also explores The Little Hours by Caridad Svich (2020) and the works Snow (2000) and Firefall (2006) by John Jesurun, two playwrights from the Cuban and Puerto Rican diasporas, respectively  to observe the kind of interaction that takes place between performers and spectators. Finally, I introduce a discussion about the possibilities of accessing these platforms and productions inside Cuba and Puerto Rico, and which can be the constraints to maintain this kind of staging as a productive work.  Research interests: Latin-American and Cuban documentary film studies and performance arts, transmedia narratives.
